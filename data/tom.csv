13-miles,2007,blink-182,Rock,"13 miles down the road lives a young boy
He's got jet black hair and blue-green eyes
And he's mine
And every now and then, he and I
Would sit together on the porch
And I take off his pants
And I fuck him from behind
And I love him for his heart and soul
And I love his wrinkled scrotum too
So if you see us passing by
On some dreary rainy day
Take a look at the young boy
And his naked asshole"
21-days,2006,blink-182,Rock,"My mind wanders as I'm trying not to fall in love with you
'Cause every time I awake I ponder on my mistakes of
What I said, it is always my esteem that I sure lose
Playing those stupid games as I always end up chasing you
I can't help myself anymore
Rehearsing my thoughts as I'm too scared to come to your door
I pushed it all aside just to stand next to you
But now you won't talk to me for something that I didn't do
It's not gonna work
And I'm trying not to think of you
I'm all confused as I think of the things that I would do
I'm all shook up as I get all nervous inside
My emotions are something that I will always hide"

Will we still feel pain inside
Will these scars go away with night
Stars smile for the morning light
It's like the best dream to have
Where everything is not so bad
Every tear is so alone
Like God himself is coming home
To say I
I can do anything, if you want me here
And I can fix anything, if you'll let me near
Where are those secrets now
That you're just scared to tell
I whisper them all aloud
So you can hear yourself
Dreams were the first sign
The deepest blue, the clearest sky
The silence came with brightest eyes
Like turning water into wine
The children ran to see
The parents stood in disbelief
And those who know braced for the ride
The Earth itself then came alive
To say I
I can do anything, if you want me here
And I can fix anything, if you'll let me near
Where are those secrets now
That you're just scared to tell
I whisper them all aloud
So you can hear yourself
I'm sorry to say it, but you look like you're sad
Your smile is gone, I noticed it bad
The secret's if you let in just a little more love
I promise you this, a little's enough

I'd search the moons of Endor
I'd even walk naked through
The deserts of Tatooine
Princess Leia, where are you tonight?
And who's laying there by your side?
Every night I fall asleep with you
And I wake up alone
And even though I'm not as cool as Han
I still want to be your man
You're exactly the kind of
Alderranian that I need
But when you were available, I was
Drinking Colt 45's with Lando
I was hanging out in the cantina
On Mos Eisley

I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault
I never conquered, when you came
Sixteen just held such better days

For real 'cause you were driving me crazy
Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
Do you grin inside, you're killing me

I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end is not too far away
Did you know, I'm here to stay
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I can hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy

Sent from above.
My hands are tied to worlds alone,
And this I know.
Your breath's like wine,
And just like clouds, my skin crawls.
It's so divine, the sky it glows with fields of light.
Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me.
I love you.
And honestly, I will love you.
You make me feel alive,
And I'll love you
Until the end of time.
My hands shake clasped with fear as you come near
To say goodnight, just like a dove.
A peaceful sign.
To help us by as you come in.
Let this begin.
Stars fall like dust, our lips will touch.
We speak too much.
Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me.
I love you.
And honestly, I will love you.
You make me feel alive,
And I'll love you
Until the end of time.
Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me.
I love you.
And honestly, I will love you.
You make me feel alive,
And I'll love you
Until the end of time.
I've got a lot to say, if you will let me
It's always hard, when you're around me
But here right now, there's interest in your eyes
So hear me out, and hear this the first time
That I love you (come and lay with me)
That I love you (and all this day)
And I love you (you make me feel alive)
That I love you
Till the end of time"

And the thousands of stars come out thousands of times
And we can go, only if you believe.

Do you feel like you've lost everything you can lose?

Calling out in a moment of need.
Do you ever lay awake with a look in the eye?
Asking god if a wish is too big to deny?
I will offer a line. And it is ready for use.
Let me know are you ready for me?
I'd like to say, that you're my only fear.
And when I dream, it slowly disappears.
And when I wake. I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart, beat in and out of time.
When the storm brings rain, snow, fate of all kinds,
You can feel almost anything.
When the day seems to melt, fall flat into night,
You can feel almost anything.
When you can't go on, you got to get up and try.
This is it, can you feel me?
And when the bombs come down. We will make it alive.

Approached with vague intentions
Betray my short attention
Span the distance
Bridge the border
Beg forgiveness
Round the corner

And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But everytime I look for you the sun goes down once more

More time apart will give you
A few more months to argue
Is this too much to live through?
It always seemed to far to
Drive the point home
Send more letters
Pray tomorrow
Ends up better

And everything's here to explore,
It's all unlike, the usual,
A different place but beautiful,
And it is not quite as it seems,
I hear the children's laughs and screams,
Ohhhh, It's beautiful!
Ohhhh, So beautiful!

Passed down from father to son
Hopeless and destitute
Destroyed by gratitude

Through a one-way window with two different faces

Wake up and see someone else's morals
What is right to you, might be true
It's a different point of view to you
You cannot see things that are different to me
I can't understand why you cannot see
The things that I cannot see
I see what you don't see, I see what you don't see

pretty-little-girl,2012,blink-182,Rock,"Nineteen, your eyes are glowing to my beating heart
Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you
Whatcha gonna do
Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl
And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued
She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again
Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes they cannot lie as you're dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl
In the rain with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart it is hard
We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are
You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to do it again
Wait a minute hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling
Like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both
Like you never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back
Was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones
Kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
And I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own
So I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
'Cause I know that me and you is just only right but one
It's a cry from the past we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we cheer in the morrow
The ropes to the light from the crypt to the grave
We started alone in the end we're okay
You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to try it again"

rite-of-spring,2007,angels-and-airwaves,Rock,"I was locked all day in the summer heat,
In a small brown house in suburban streets
With a skateboard and my shit guitar,
I dreamed all day that they would get me far.
My dad would ask me about my grades,
The asshole sports that I never played.
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date,
Behind our back when mom had stayed up late.
It was near when I turned sixteen,
Got kicked out of school and so it seemed,
Things were closing in and ready to blow.
My dad moved out about that year or so.
It took an hour to start a punk rock band,
To upset my fucked up family land.
And as I held my mum would start to cry,
I swore ourselves, a better life
If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldn't change a thing
This made me all on who I am inside
And if I could thank God
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine
The summers gone, the years have passed,
My friends have changed, a few did last,
The smallest dreams got pushed aside,
The largest ones that changed my life,
And all I wish for was come to past
From rock and roll, to love and cash
It's all success if it's what you need
Do what you like and do it honestly
If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldn't change a thing
This made me all on who I am inside
And if I could thank God
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

About you again

Lay beside me

Right off a fucking cliff

We all are love and love is hard
Were hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
So here's my heart
I cant close my eyes
The east end barrels, its summer time
The west coast lives got butterflies
So literal
Cold, unbearable
Life's so terrible
Kids live fearlessly and curious lives
Grow up to be so serious
Lost time, broken dreams
So usual
Unpredictable, life's a miracle
We all are love and love is hard
Were hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
It breaks my heart
We all are love and love is hard

Down on the floor
And then it seems like
You don't love me anymore
Sometimes I wish that
I could run away
Sometimes I wish
I just had something to say
She looks at me and doesn't
Know the words to say
But it's not you, I just don't
Feel quite right today
All these things I say and
Do were never planned
But how the fuck am I supposed
To make you understand that

You don't love me anymore

There is a light, when we're asleep
We're barely doors, with locks and keys
With feelings of our hopes and fears
As sounds explode within our ears
Like stars at night
falling fast asleep
on the risen sun
Wait patiently,
you can feel it 'cause it's always there
Growing stronger as you stare and stare
Like love and lies shake violently
down to the core to foster grief
It has a way to keep me down
I gotta say it wears me out
So sadly soul survivors
Lost and lonely in open water
Yeah oh, yeah oh, yeah oh, yeah oh
Help I'm losing, help I'm falling
Life is silent, the earth is calling
Every reason, every nighttime
And every day starts and ends in sunlight
But I'm not okay with this vicious cycle
Something's broken, it seems unnatural
These shapes are wondrous,
but loosely woven
The sounds are deafening,
and time is frozen

A blend of fear and passion
Do you know what it's like to believe?

I laid them out in stone in case they need to last forever

Do you want to come to a party
My friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30
This things at a frat house but the people are cool there
Reluctant I followed but I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
So I paid my 3 and the girls got in free
Shine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party
And then in the backyard some terrible ska band
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame all these girls look the same
All these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed
In my bed back at home watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate down from anywhere state
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party
And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blond hair
She wasn't wearing underwear at least I prayed that
She might be the one maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night I learned some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard to impress
With the way that they dress
With those things on their chests
And the things they suggest to me
I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping the games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly's
How she's down with the Iwise well constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her but never would bother
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party
So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover
This girl's not the one and she'll never be fun
You should just turn and run because you'll find out that
Some girls try too hard

When we all have a choice then
We act a like a man
Will you raise up your hands?
When the shit hits the fan
Turn white as a ghost
As the air leaves your throat
Will you throw me a rope?
Or go at it alone?
It's a little late
In a little while
Can we forget about it?
With a little lake
Have a little fire
Well take the fun out of it
Pour a little wine
Take a little meal
Pack a little bag
And a wallet
Get a bit of ice
And a heavy meal
There is no easy way out
As your pray for the end to come
All you'll get is a marching line
As you wait for the hounds of hell
You'll be in for a big surprise
Can you tell me your name girl?
Does the cat have your tongue?
Are you calling someone?
Are you waiting to run?
When the show will arrive
It will be right on time
So you better sit tight
It will be a great ride
It's a little late
In a little while
Can we forget about it?
With a little lake
Have a little fire
Well take the fun out of it
Pour a little wine
Take a little meal
Pack a little bag

And a heavy meal
There is no easy way out
As your pray for the end to come
All you'll get is a marching line
As you wait for the hounds of hell
You'll be in for a big surprise
'Cause the end, it will never come
But were in for a few hard times
And well get knocked up down and done
But the truth is were still alive
Where are we going
Come on over
No ones dying
Were fine
As your pray for the end to come
All you'll get is a marching line
As you wait for the hounds of hell
You'll be in for a big surprise

Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there
She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
I'm kind of nervous cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and that made it I swear
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call
She always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance
I'd still ask her to dance

The days have come and gone
Our lives went by so fast
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Where I laid and told you, but you sweared you loved me more

Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
Will I shake this off pretend its all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
There is
Those notes you wrote me
I've kept them all
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
With every single letter in every single word
There will be a hidden message about a boy that
Loves a girl

And the words they escape me
But I'm full of dumb luck
And the world is an oyster
With a poisonous shell
And the look in my eye
Is a look that can kill
And Dream a bit
I am not, without emotion
I have ran, from the pain of my will
From the mess of a hunt and a catch, and the thrill
And I'm ill
I am known, in the circles of envy
I'd thank God, but then what is he for
Cause I left a few hard calls at his front door
I'll leave more
Don't you go
Come a little bit closer now
If you like
When you die
Wake your soul
To a little light fire now

Do whatever your heart commands

Sitting at home,
Thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time
Remembering how
She laughed at Kinko's
When I made fun of that guy
Remembering the look
She gave me
When I told her that
I used to fly
I really want to ask her out
But my ego could never take it
And even if I got the balls
You know that the Cougar
Would never make it
And in my town
You can't drive naked
And maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her
Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and
Wondering if I'm
Sitting at home,
Thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Wasting my time
Thinking about a girl"
watch-the-world,2006,boxcar-racer,Rock,"I watched the smoke
As it grew darker
And blew up through the roof
I watched the fad
Who sobbed in panic
As the fire grew
I saw Virginia
Get rid of Langley, and its secrets too
I held your hand
And sat there knowing
That we'd make it through
I saw this man
Dispose of hunger
And soap opera too
I saw this field
That grew perfection
Full of things you do
I saw this box
Get rid of heartache
And cure cancer too
When I awoke
I sat there hoping
This is what we'll do
If we can
We will leave our letter and this song, for you
And we'll write, once a day
And float it through the sea, to you
We'll regret, all those things we thought of but didn't ever do
If we can, we will leave our letter and this song, for you
And we'll write, once a day
And float it through the sea, to you
We'll regret, all those things we thought of but didn't ever do
When the sky, seems to clear
Who will then be left, but a few, me and you"
we-are-all-that-we-are,2012,angels-and-airwaves,Rock,"The ice is really cold the street lights really old
Her child's all alone as she notes into her own
And slowly fades away and into a river or full of shame
But I least numb to the pain, can you see it?
Can you feel the shallow wave from a needle to the grave
From our hell to faraway your my only
You're so sad my valentine on your journey to the light
But first straight to the fire
(Chorus)
And we are
All that we are
Holding on until we fall apart
And we are
All that we are
Holding on until we fall apart
And we are
All that we are
Holding on until we fall apart
And we are
All that we are
Holding on until we fall apart
And we are
All that we are, All that we are
All that we are, All That we are
All That we are, All That we are
All that we are, All that we are"
wendy-clear,2000,blink-182,Rock,"Let's take the boat out on the bay
Forget your job for just one day
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
It might be inappropriate because
Either way our band gets dropped, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
The three-date theory is getting old
Everyone is getting left out in the cold
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
So I'll see you with another guy
Who pretends not to hear you when you cry, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I'll be moving on, moving on
Moving on, and on and on
Moving on, moving on
Moving on and on and on
But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad"
what-s-my-age-again,2000,blink-182,Rock,"I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is A.D.D.?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops
And your husband's in jail
The state looks down on sodomy
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
That's about the time she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never want to act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
What's my age again?"
what-went-wrong,2006,blink-182,Rock,"I'm sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy
That he's lost and alone, yeah
I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone
I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life
I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place is fucking cursed in its plague
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes
I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life
I'm kicking out fiercely of the world around me
What went wrong
I'm kicking"
when-i-was-young,2012,blink-182,Rock,"I woke up today
Surrounded by blackness
A small warning sign
Devoured the process
It's always been fine
I get up and ignore this
And it's hard to say
But I feel all of this weightless
But the more that I admit
I feel up and anxious
And the more I go on
The less I can face this
And those rotten things
That live in our shadow
We walk on the line
Of death and the gallows
And hope that we're clear
I bet we can follow
It's the worst damn day (doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn't hurt that much)
But I'm alright (doesn't hurt that much)
When I was young
The world it was smaller
The cities were vast
The buildings were taller
I felt really strong
My parents seem stronger
My life has a way
Showers with greatness
Then takes it away
Those pieces that made us
The dangerous things
You'd never imagine
We all get the same
The memories that burn
And those pictures we made
They still form a pattern
They courteously say
Does it not matter?
It's the worst damn day (doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn't hurt that much)
But I'm alright (doesn't hurt that much)
It's the worst damn day (doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn't hurt that much)
But I'm alright
It's the worst damn day (doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn't hurt that much)
But I'm alright (doesn't hurt that much)
It's the worst damn day (doesn't hurt that much)
Of my life
I made a mess today (doesn't hurt that much)

when-you-fucked-grandpa,2006,blink-182,Rock,"Uno, Dos, Tres, Cuatro...
When you fucked grandpa did he tell you that he loved you?
Did he hold you till the sun did rise, and did he look into ur eyes, and ask u to felate him, and stick a finger or two in his ass?
He seems like a total asshole.
Grandpa is a total fucking ass hole.
Whoo would ever want a dirty, greasy, finger in his ass? He rubs his dick in broken glass..."
wishing-well,2011,blink-182,Rock,"Been gone a long time I kinda lost my way, can't find you
And I caught a short ride to the grave and back this season
I can try to get by, but every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy, a bit strange and a little bit manic
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land
On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da
I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore

won-t-be-home-for-christmas,2007,blink-182,Rock,"Outside the carolers start to sing
I can't describe the joy they bring
'Cause joy is something they don't bring me
My girlfriend is by my side
Pick her up while hanging sickles of ice
Their whiny voices get irritating
It's Christmas time again
So I stand with a dead smile on my face
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste
Oh god, I hate these Satan's helpers
And then I guess I must have snapped
Because I grabbed a baseball bat
And made them all run for shelter
It's Christmas time
Again
It's time to be nice to the people who
You can't stand, all year
I'm growing tired of this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get me down
Just leave the presents and let me be alone
Well I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas eve
Because the cops came and arrested me
They had an unfair advantage
And even though the jail didn't have a tree
Christmas came a night early
As a guy named Bubba unwrapped my package
It's Christmas time
Again
It's time to be nice to the people who
You can't stand, all year
I'm growing tired of this Christmas cheer
You people scare me
Please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get me down
Just leave the presents and let me be alone
I won't be home
I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home"
young-london,2009,angels-and-airwaves,Rock,"I'm not the one to complain of bad dreams
It's like disease, but without a life
It's all a scene with this great directive
That we're all lost and we're stuck in time
We feel alone in a strange blue ocean
And we're all scared as death to die
I'm not the one to admit it's helpless
I have a sense that we will be alright
I wish for peace with electric silence
To keep our hearts beating on our minds
And we will see that we're all connected
When we awake to the tunnel's light
[Repeat x2]
(Suit up, boys
We're on vacation
With endless stay and reservations
Saddest girls
Who will await while dying inside
How will they get by?)
[Repeat x4]
(Suit up, boys
Let's ride, it's the weekend
Get down, girls
And dance with your best friend
Show yourselves, and take what you ask for
Let it go, no fights on the dance floor)"
zulu,2006,blink-182,Rock,"I'm feeling what I want to feel
I'm saying what I've said all along
Because I know the things that are important to me
Because life is too short to be long
And those thoughts
That I've kept inside
With those words
That I could not hide
Before those times that always remind me
That all I ever did was try
So change your tune one step to make a stand
I want to speak my mind start my own African tribe
I'm alone now, run into the deepest pile of shit
Cause that's where I'm going to blend in, go!
Those choices that I've never made
With those decisions that once cut me a break
Cause after all what's left in the end
There's somethings that they just can't take
So take a bow
Well you're not that great
Go pat your back
Go off and masturbate
'Cause one thing that you know for sure
Your hand is not a lonesome date"
